# 🚀 My Journey
🏦 Alior Bank (2024–present):
Building efficient task and time-tracking solutions using Power Apps, automating processes with Power Automate and VBA, and managing data in Oracle/ Teradata SQL environments — often dealing with both modern and very legacy datasets.

💻 Independent Projects:

- Developed and deployed two major web applications in .NET (RNN Web App, Bank App)

- Built advanced business dashboards in Power BI for data-driven decision making

- Designed and hosted a tech portal/blog, PC-HUB.pl (2018–2021), dedicated to PC hardware news and reviews — managed everything from content to backend infrastructure

🏛️ Public Sector Internship:
Delivered data analytics and process optimization for the Municipal Office in Kutno, creating Sharepoint and OneDrive workflow improvements and data visualization tools.
